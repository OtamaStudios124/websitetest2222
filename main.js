    <h2>Welcome to otama's free online games! Here you'll find a collection of games I have made myself, hopefully they are getting better with every release. I am slowly making new games, I am mostly focusing on small scale arcade games. If you're interested in putting some of these on your website, head down to the bottom and go to the info page. Enjoy the games!
